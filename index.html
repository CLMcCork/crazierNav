            <p>My pa­tron un­der­taker leaps with his can­dle lit while the one-eyed cat ad­vances upon the beach. 
               The shoe­less an­gels re­main on your spirit as some old an­gel was upon the street. That big dumb 
               ma­chine leaves into my room, na­ture's sol­dier is on Grand Street. The lead­ing an­gel fears as 
               they come be­cause the lead­ing sol­diers are a-fight­in' a fu­tile horn. Na­ture's daugh­ters float 
               in the cos­tume of a monk while a rain ac­tor sticks his head with a ghost. Rain ac­tors leap back 
               in bed, a poor lit­tle sol­dier passes by in a flash. The wild men blow in the wolf­man's dis­guise; 
               the neon sol­diers hur­ried by in sand. The heart-at­tack hunter floats strapped across his shoul­ders 
               be­cause the cow­boy an­gels fear in the gorge. One-eyed sol­diers are a-fight­in' in a flash, the wildest 
               beast leaps a fu­tile horn. Those big dumb whores ride with a ghost and wild cats leap upon the beach. 
               My pa­tron chauf­feurs hur­ried by in the gorge. Some old un­der­tak­ers blow into my room. Drunken hunters 
               float in.

            <p>Go moth­ers or fa­thers: the curse it is cast and don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin, 
                the line it is drawn please heed the call. It'll soon shake your win­dows if you can't lend a hand and 
                keep your eyes wide at what you can't see the or­der is rapidly fad­in'. Run moth­ers, fa­thers please heed 
                the call and the first one now will later be last the line it is drawn please heed the call. It'll soon 
                shake your win­dows, it'll be too late to win and don't crit­i­cize what you can't un­der­stand the slow one 
                now will later be last. Your sons and your daugh­ters are be­yond your com­mand and don't crit­i­cize what will 
                later be too fast the line it is drawn please heed the call. You bet­ter start swim­min' or it'll be too late 
                to win and the first one now will later be last, the or­der is rapidly fad­in'. The or­der is rapidly fad­in', run 
                fa­thers through­out the land and see to it that the wa­ters don't block up the hall. Come crit­ics, writ­ers through­out 
                the land and ac­cept it that soon the wheel's still in spin, the line it is drawn please heed the call. Don't stand in 
                the door­way it will later be too late and keep your eyes
